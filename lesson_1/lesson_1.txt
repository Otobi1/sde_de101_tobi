Assignment:

Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements?
 Hint: Think backward from what the business may need.


Solution 

Objective 
    - Enable data analytics through dashboards and self-serve solutions for data analytics

Summary 
    - Data Source -> Gathering -> Modelling -> End User Access -> Continuous Testing/Monitoring

    - As clearly described here - https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/n-job-reponsibilities-of-a-data-engineer/, a key part of enabling analytics in any organisation is the movement of data from one system to the other. 
    - It also includes making sure that the data is in formats that are relatively easier to handle for end users.

Data Sources 
    - Identify the data sources and gather the specs including pros and cons of various options to be used in data ingestion 

Data Collection/Gathering
    - Prepare ELT for continuous and scheduled data ingestion, including transformation from raw formats into formats and structures that are easier to handle
    - Partitioning and loading into storage 
    
Data Modelling in Warehouse   
    - Modelling the dimension and fact tables 
 
Visualisation and End User Access   
    - In some cases, data engineers could be involved in creating Visualisations. In most cases they ensure visualisation tools are able to connect to the Data Warehouse/Store.
    - They also ensure that applications that would require access to data store for near-realtime processing are enabled.
